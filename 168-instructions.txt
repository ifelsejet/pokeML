CSE 168 Lab 3 - Who's That Pokemon?
Collaborators: Brandon Ortega, Axel Martinez Siliezar, Jatnael Montes

Instructions: 
1. Download datasets off Box link inside report
2. Open 'PokeML_DenseNet301.ipynb' to run data augmention on dataset (will only augment data if variable "upload" is TRUE & folder contains less than 200 images)
3. Open 'Copy_of_Pkemon_lab.ipynb' to run the actual model

Potential Issues:
* Since we are using Google Drive on a shared folder, the code might not work out of the box. Some workarounds are:
- Upload dataset to Google Drive and update the Drive directories
- Change the directory to use a local directory (issue with uploading augments to Google Drive, would have to change that)
- Even with smaller batch_sizes, or lower epochs, the model generally takes a long time to run. Even with a dedicated GPU, we normally had to wait over 4 hours to train 5 epochs with the current parameters
